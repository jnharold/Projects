# <center> Deep Learning:   A Fad or Here To Stay?</center>

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to learn and improve with experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.  This field of study has grown significantly in recent years.  

Deep learning (a form of machine learning) is based on creating artifical neural networks that mimic the biological neural connections that exist in our own brains.  With the myriad applications of deep learning across many industries, its popularity has seen a sharp rise.

For this project we will take the role of a content writer for a data science magazine to see if there is any indication of this being a fad or if it is here to stay.  

To examine the trend we are going to pull data relating to all of questions posted to Stack Exchange data science website ([DSSE](https://datascience.stackexchange.com)).  Stack Exchange employs a reputation award system for its questions and answers. Each post is subject to upvotes and downvotes. Questions with more upvotes have more visibility.  

The content posted on the DSSE is wholly dependant on what people in the data science community are posting.  In this sense, our data and our conclusions are based on patterns in the community itself.  

The data was pulled using the Stack Exchange Data Explorer ([SEDE](https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/new)).  The SEDE uses a built in SQL query system for pulling data from the site.
