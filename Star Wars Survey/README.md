# <center>Analyzing Star Wars Survey Data</center>

We will be analysing data from a poll of over 1100 Star Wars fans. The website FiveThirtyEight ran the poll before the release of the release of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.  The poll collected demographic data of the respondants as well favorite characters, ranking their favorite Star Wars movie, and more.  

The data is available on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).  You can read more about the poll in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/).

We will analyze responses to some of the questions accross gender lines and education level.
