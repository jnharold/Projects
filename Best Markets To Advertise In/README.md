# Finding The Best Markets To Advertise In

For this project we will take the role of a data analyst who works for an e-learning company.  While the company focuses on courses in web and mobile development, it also offers programs in data science and game development.  The company wants to invest in advertisement and wants to know what the two best markets are to invest in.

To gain insight into who is learning to code, we will  we will examine the results of a survey released by freeCodeCamp.  The survey received 31,000 repsonses to over 50 questions. 

You can read more about the survey [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/) and more about the data on their [github repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey)

Examining this survey is a good first step since organizing our own survey would be costly and time consuming.
