# Exploring The Causes of SAT Performance in NYC Public Schools

The quality of education and causes of disparity in public school performance has always been a top priority of parents, education administrators, and elected offcials.  New York City is home to the largest public school system in the United States with over 1 million students and a budget of over $30 billion.  Here we will look at various demographic metrics and evaluate their impact on SAT scores.  

The Scholastic Aptitude Test or SAT is a nationally standarized test that higher education institutions use in their admission decisions.  It consists of 3 parts: each has a maximum of 800 points for a maximum of 2400.  The SAT is often used as a measure of a school's overall quality.
