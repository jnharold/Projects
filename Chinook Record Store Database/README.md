# <center>Chinook Records Store Database</center>

In this project we will be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - a smaller version of iTunes.  We will attempt to find patterns in the data and make business recommendations based on our observations.

The database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and their purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.
